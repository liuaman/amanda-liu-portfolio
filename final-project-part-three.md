# The final data story
https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/a828eaa9-8510-40de-8bfb-8f2781efecec/index.html

# Changes made since Part II & Final design decisions
1. I added a new graphic to show what policies retail companies are using to address the growing tendency of this behavior.
2. I made the chart larger for better readability and aligned the color scheme with the topic (brown for return boxes). The left Y-axis uses the same color as the bar chart (brown), and the right Y-axis matches the line chart (red). The annotation also changed to brown for consistency.
3. I added an annotation to indicate that 2023 data is missing, instead of only mentioning it in the subtitle, so it’s more noticeable.
4. I highlighted a few key statistics as visual callouts.
5. I changed to a stronger CTA: “We can’t stop all returns, but we can shop smarter and more mindfully.”

## The audience

My target audience is the general public, especially Gen Z consumers who care about sustainability. Based on feedback from my classmates, I added an environmental perspective to the project and reframed my storyline. Initially, my story focused on the rising costs for retail companies. But as consumers, why should we care about this issue? So I brought in data points such as carbon emissions and the amount of returned products that end up in landfills, connecting the growth of returns to their environmental impact.

# Final thoughts

This project really helped me improve my Tableau skills. For example, I got the chance to explore dual-axis charts and troubleshoot bugs when I had difficulties building the visualizations I wanted. 

Data-wise, I wish I could access data on how many returned items went straight to landfills each year. During interviews and presentations, I noticed that many people were surprised by this fact. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore the trend over time. However, I was only able to find data from 2022.

Topic-wise, I think this project is meaningful, not only raising awareness for my classmates and friends, but also for myself. I realized that I’ve also taken part in some of these abusive behaviors, or buying impulsively and returning items later, especially during major shopping events such as Amazon Prime Day or Black Friday. Working on this project made me reflect on my own habits and better understand the hidden costs behind reverse logistics.
