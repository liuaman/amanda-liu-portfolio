# Outline
 
Today’s customer journey includes an increasingly important landmark: Returns. According to the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns (a UPS company), 76% of consumers consider free returns a key factor in deciding where to shop. However, over the past five years, the rapid growth of returns has created significant challenges for the environment and logistics, while also imposing huge costs on the retail industry. I would like to explore how severe this problem is to raise awareness and explore return behavior across different generations.


Retail return rates have nearly doubled in five years, creating massive hidden costs for businesses and the environment.

As a reader, I want to understand how frequent returns affect costs and waste, so that I can make more mindful shopping decisions.
I can do this by checking sizing guides or reducing impulsive purchases.

Story telling:
1. Present the growth of return rates and costs.
2. What’s Driving Returns? -> Focus on generational differences in return exploitive behaviors.
3. Why It Matters & Call-to-action

(Sep 30th update)
I've slightly reframed my storyline based on feedback from classmates. I connected the growth of returns to environmental costs, since at first my story only highlighted the rising costs for retail companies. But as consumers, why should we care about this issue? To address that, I brought in data points such as carbon emissions and the amount of returns sent straight to landfills, which will be presented in part 2 assignment. Once I highlighted how the return journey creates significant environmental issues that often go unnoticed, it became the key to raise awareness.

* Note: NRF’s 2023 study on retail returns used a different methodology to calculate the return rate that is not directly comparable to other years’ data.

# The data
NRF and Happy Returns 2024 Consumer Returns in the Retail Industry (Dec 5, 2024):
https://nrf.com/research/2024-consumer-returns-retail-industry
I used data on historical return rates and the cost of retail returns, as well as on abusive or exploitative consumer return behaviors across different generations.

# Method and medium
I plan to use Tableau for my data visualization but I’m open to Shorthand too as I continue exploring.

## AI acknowledgements
1. I used ChatGPT to help refine my wording.
2. I asked ChatGPT to critique my visualization, and used its recommendation to add contextual information, such as noting that the cost of returns in 2024 equals 8.4 times Target’s annual revenue.
