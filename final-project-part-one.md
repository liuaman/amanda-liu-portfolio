# Outline
 
Today’s customer journey includes an increasingly important landmark: Returns. According to the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns (a UPS company), 76% of consumers consider free returns a key factor in deciding where to shop. However, over the past five years, the rapid growth of returns has created significant challenges for the environment and logistics, while also imposing huge costs on the retail industry. I would like to explore how severe this problem is to raise awareness and explore return behavior across different generations.


Retail return rates have nearly doubled in five years, creating massive hidden costs for businesses and the environment.

As a reader, I want to understand how frequent returns affect costs and waste, so that I can make more mindful shopping decisions.
I can do this by checking sizing guides or reducing impulsive purchases.

Story telling:
1. Present the growth of return rates.
2. What’s Driving Returns? -> Focus on generational differences in return behaviors.
3. Why It Matters & Call-to-action
