## Target audience

Although I think everyone could be part of my target audience since this topic relates to the environment and people’s shopping and return behavior, I plan to narrow it down to focus specifically on young adults like us. Because I highlight the generational differences in abusive return behavior, which younger shoppers are more likely to engage in. The data chart highlights a key point that connects directly to my call-to-action: Be more mindful when shopping.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| To understand if my data charts are clear enough without too much explanation |  What questions came up?  |
| To get critique on my current chart design  | What worked? What didn't work?  |
| To understand if my storyline is clear enough |  Do you think the storytelling makes sense?       |


## Interview findings
Through the interviews, visualizations sometimes add confusion if I don’t tell the story well. Also, suggestions are very subjective, and sometimes they conflict with each other, so you don’t need to take all of them.

| Questions               | Art Management Student | MIIPS Student | Financial Analyst |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Do you feel it’s distracting when noticing missing data at your first glance at the chart? | Yes, I suggest showing data every two years instead of continuously, so 2023 can be skipped    |   Yes, maybe explain it first during storytelling   |  Yes, maybe use an annotation to highlight it better  |
| Do you have any questions or difficulties when trying to understand the chart?  |  The heatmap has a lot of information, so it’s hard to see that you want to highlight Gen Z. Maybe it could have a clearer title that gets straight to the point (I already fixed this)  |  For the first chart with the dual Y-axis, it’s a bit difficult to tell which side the bar chart/line chart refers to  |   For the heatmap, you can gray out other generations so it’s clearer you’re mainly talking about Gen Z     |
| Do you find the annotation comparing the return cost with Target’s revenue helpful? |  Yes, I like it   |  Yes, but I suggest using the same color as the bar chart so I know you’re linking it to the return cost, not the return rate   |  Yes, when the numbers get so large that they go beyond perception, I become numb to them. With a comparison, I can see just how staggering the number is   |  


# Identified changes for Part III
Based on the feedback, the main problems in Part2 include insufficient visualization and too much text on Shorthand. Even though I couldn't find a complete dataset, adding simple pie charts or bar charts could reduce the heavy text. Other feedback suggested improving the data charts with a more reader-centric design.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Too much text and feel a bit overwhelming | I’ll improve it with stronger visualizations |
| The concern of data missing in the first Chart |  I’ll add an annotation instead of just putting it in the subtitle, and when storytelling, I’ll explain it first    |
| Dual Axis and Annotation   |   I’ve fixed it. The left Y-axis uses the same color as the bar chart (brown), and the right Y-axis uses the same color as the line chart (red). As for the annotation, it should be brown too   |
| Too much info on a single chart, feel lost and not sure where to focus on   |  I’ll use mouse/hand gestures to help readers follow my explanation of the chart    |

I appreciate all the feedback. After looking at my charts too many times, I had become numb to them, so the feedback helped me reflect a lot!
