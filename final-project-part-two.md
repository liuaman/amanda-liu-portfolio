# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 



## Target audience

Though I think everyone could be my target audience because this topic is related to environment and people's shopping and return bahavior, but I think I'll narrow it down to reach young adults like us specifically. Since I show the generational differences in abusive return bahavior, which younger shoppers are more likely to engage in, it's an important bridge link to my Call-To-Action.

## Interview script

| To seek critique advice on my current chart design  | What worked? What didn't work?  |
| To understand if my storyline is clear enough |  Do think the storytelling makes sense?       |

# Identified changes for Part III
Based on the feedback, main problems for Part2 includes the unenough visualization, they feel like text is still a bit too much on shorthand.
