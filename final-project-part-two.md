## Target audience

Although I think everyone could be part of my target audience since this topic relates to the environment and peopleâ€™s shopping and return behavior, I plan to narrow it down to focus specifically on young adults like us. Because I highlight the generational differences in abusive return behavior, which younger shoppers are more likely to engage in. The data chart highlights a key point that connects directly to my call-to-action: Be more mindful when shopping.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| To understand if my data charts are clear enough without too much explanation |  What questions came up?  |
| To seek critique advice on my current chart design  | What worked? What didn't work?  |
| To understand if my storyline is clear enough |  Do think the storytelling makes sense?       |


## Interview findings
Through interview, visulization sometimes add confusion if I don't tell the story well. Also, suggestions are really depending on people so you don't need to take it all. 

| Questions               | Student in Art Management program| Student in MIIPS program | Financial Analyst |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Do you feel like it's distracting when seeing data missed at your first glance to the chart | Yes, suggested showing data every two year instead of continuous years so 2023 can be skipped    |   Yes, maybe explain it first when storytelling   |  Yes, maybe use an annotation to highlight it better  |
| Do you have questions or difficulties when understanding the chart?  |  The heatmap one has a lot of information, so it's hard to get that I want to highlight GenZ, maybe can change it with a better tilte that go straight to the point (I already fixed)  |  For the first chart with dual Y axis, it's a bit difficult to know bar chart/line chart is for left or right  |   For the heatmap, maybe you can grey other generation so I can get you're talking mainly about GenZ     |
| Do you find the annotation of comparing the return cost with Target's revenue helpful? |  Yes, I like it   |  Yes, but I suggest using a same color with the bar chart so that I know you're linking it to the return cost, not return rate   |  Yes, when the numbers get so large that they go beyond your perception, you become numb to them. With a comparison, you can feel just how staggering the number is.   |  


# Identified changes for Part III
Based on the feedback, main problems for Part2 includes the unenough visualization, they feel like text is still a bit too much on shorthand. Even without a compete data set, some simple pie chart or bar chart could reduce the heavt text. Others feedback includes improve the data chart with more reader-centric design.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Too much text and feel a bit overwhelming | I'll improve it with stronger visualizations |
| The concern of data missing in the first Chart |  I'll add an annotation instead of just putting it in the subtitle, and when storytelling, explain it first     |
| Dual Axis and Annotation   |   I've fixed it with left Y Axis using same color as the bar chart(brown), right Y Axis same color with the line chart. (Red) So with the annotation, should go with brown.                                                                            |
| Too much info on a single chart, feel lost and not sure where to focus on   |  I'll use mouse/hand gesture to help readers follow my explanation to the chart    |
I appreciate these feedabck, I looked my charts for too many times and got numb, they help me a lot on reflection!
